# Demographic Data Analyzer
The second certification project for the [***Data Analysis with Python***](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/) course on the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) platform.

This project aims to answer the following questions (though I have added some additional insights/info for a personal touch)
- How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (race column)
- What is the average age of men?
- What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
- What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?
- What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
- What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
- What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
- What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
- Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.
